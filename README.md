# Real vs. Fake Identifier
This repository contains a project for identifying real vs. fake data using machine learning techniques. The project includes Python code in a Jupyter Notebook format to preprocess data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

- Training machine learning models for real vs. fake classification.

- Model evaluation and performance analysis.

- Visualization of classification results.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook

- Basic knowledge of machine learning and data analysis.
